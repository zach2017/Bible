Below is a focused analysis identifying the *first-mentioned* Old Testament verses with connections to the Book of Revelation, limited strictly to the verses themselves, their direct or implied relationships to specific Revelation verses, and vivid imagery to illustrate the links. As requested, I’ve excluded scholarly references and additional commentary, keeping only the essential elements: the Old Testament verse, its Revelation counterpart, and the imagery bridging them. To maintain concision and avoid redundancy, I’ve selected the earliest verse in the Old Testament for each major motif (e.g., creation, redemption, judgment, restoration) with a clear tie to Revelation, covering distinct themes across the canon. The list is streamlined to nine entries for clarity, but I can adjust if you need more or fewer.

### Notes on Approach
- **Focus**: Limited to Old Testament verses, their direct/implied Revelation counterparts, and imagery, as requested. No scholarly references or extra commentary included.
- **Selection**: Chose the *earliest* verse per motif (creation, tree of life, serpent, redemption, covenant, victory, Messiah’s birth, return, kingship) with clear Revelation ties, ensuring distinct themes. Genesis dominates early entries due to its primacy, but Exodus, Isaiah, Daniel, and Zechariah introduce later motifs.
- **Imagery**: Crafted to evoke symbolic continuity (e.g., serpent to dragon, tree to city) in vivid, sensory terms, linking Old Testament and Revelation contexts.
- **Exclusions**: Avoided repetitive motifs (e.g., later messianic prophecies in Isaiah) or vague links (e.g., general judgment imagery) to keep the list focused and concise.
- **Order**: Canonical order (Genesis to Zechariah) reflects the "first-mentioned" criterion across the Old Testament.

### Additional Options
- **Visuals**: If you’d like a chart or diagram (e.g., mapping verses to Revelation), I can create one with your confirmation, per guidelines.
- **Adjustments**: Want more verses, fewer motifs, or different imagery styles (e.g., poetic, modern)? Let me know.
- **Scope**: If you prefer a focus on one book (e.g., Isaiah) or specific themes (e.g., judgment), I can tailor the list.

This delivers a streamlined analysis with the requested elements—Old Testament verses, Revelation connections, and imagery. Let me know how to refine it further!
