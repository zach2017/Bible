Identifying the first-mentioned verses in Genesis that refer to or imply connections to the Book of Revelation requires a careful examination of both texts for direct references, thematic parallels, or implied foreshadowing. Below is a list of the earliest Genesis verses that can be reasonably interpreted as having connections to Revelation, based on common theological interpretations, biblical cross-references, and literary themes. I’ll focus on the *first* instances in Genesis for each type of connection, avoiding repetition, and provide brief explanations for clarity. Since Genesis is a foundational text, many of its themes resonate in Revelation, but I’ll prioritize the most explicit or widely recognized links.

### Genesis Verses with Connections to Revelation

1. **Genesis 1:1** – "In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth."
   - **Connection to Revelation**: Implies **Revelation 21:1** ("Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth…"). Genesis 1:1 establishes God as the Creator of the original heavens and earth, while Revelation 21:1 describes their renewal, forming a bookend to the biblical narrative. This is the first verse of Genesis and sets the stage for themes of creation and re-creation.
   - **Why Included**: The creation account in Genesis 1 is foundational, and its imagery of heavens and earth is echoed in Revelation’s vision of a restored cosmos.

2. **Genesis 2:9** – "And out of the ground the Lord God made to spring up every tree that is pleasant to the sight and good for food. The tree of life was in the midst of the garden, and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil."
   - **Connection to Revelation**: Refers to **Revelation 2:7** ("To the one who conquers I will grant to eat of the tree of life, which is in the paradise of God") and **Revelation 22:2** ("…the tree of life with its twelve kinds of fruit…"). The tree of life in Eden is the first mention of this symbol, which reappears in Revelation as a reward for the faithful and a feature of the New Jerusalem.
   - **Why Included**: This is the earliest mention of the tree of life, a direct link to Revelation’s eschatological imagery.

3. **Genesis 3:1** – "Now the serpent was more crafty than any other beast of the field that the Lord God had made."
   - **Connection to Revelation**: Implies **Revelation 12:9** ("…that ancient serpent, who is called the devil and Satan…") and **Revelation 20:2** ("…the dragon, that ancient serpent, who is the devil and Satan…"). The serpent in Genesis is widely interpreted as Satan, and Revelation explicitly identifies the serpent with the devil, connecting the fall to the final judgment.
   - **Why Included**: This is the first appearance of the serpent, a key figure whose defeat is central to Revelation’s narrative.

4. **Genesis 3:15** – "I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your offspring and her offspring; he shall bruise your head, and you shall bruise his heel."
   - **Connection to Revelation**: Implies **Revelation 12:1-17**, especially **Revelation 12:5** ("…she gave birth to a male child, one who is to rule all the nations with a rod of iron…") and **Revelation 20:10** (the defeat of Satan). Known as the *protoevangelium* (first gospel), this verse foreshadows the conflict between Satan and the Messiah, culminating in Satan’s defeat in Revelation.
   - **Why Included**: This is the earliest promise of redemption, pointing to Christ’s victory over Satan, a central theme in Revelation.

5. **Genesis 9:13** – "I have set my bow in the cloud, and it shall be a sign of the covenant between me and the earth."
   - **Connection to Revelation**: Implies **Revelation 4:3** ("…and around the throne was a rainbow that had the appearance of an emerald."). The rainbow in Genesis symbolizes God’s covenant of mercy, and the rainbow around God’s throne in Revelation echoes this imagery, signifying divine faithfulness in judgment.
   - **Why Included**: This is the first mention of a rainbow, a symbol that reappears in Revelation’s depiction of God’s throne.

### Notes on Methodology and Scope
- **Why These Verses?** I selected the *earliest* Genesis verses for each distinct theme or symbol (creation, tree of life, serpent, redemption, rainbow) that has a clear or widely accepted connection to Revelation. Later Genesis passages (e.g., the Abrahamic covenant or Joseph’s dreams) could have broader typological links, but these are the first instances for their respective motifs.
- **Direct vs. Implied**: Some connections are direct (e.g., tree of life), while others are implied through theological interpretation (e.g., Genesis 3:15 as the *protoevangelium*). I avoided speculative links, focusing on those supported by biblical scholarship or explicit New Testament references.
- **Exclusions**: I omitted verses with only vague or tangential connections (e.g., Genesis 1:3 and light imagery in Revelation) to keep the list concise and focused on the most significant parallels.
- **Order**: Verses are listed in their canonical order in Genesis, as the question asks for the "first mentioned" instances.

### Additional Considerations
- If you’re looking for a more exhaustive list (including later Genesis verses) or specific types of connections (e.g., typological, symbolic, or prophetic), please clarify, and I can expand the analysis.
- I didn’t generate or analyze images, as the question focuses on textual references, but I can assist with visualizations (e.g., a chart of Genesis-Revelation links) if desired.
- If you’d like me to search for additional scholarly interpretations or X posts discussing these connections, let me know.

This list captures the earliest and most prominent Genesis verses with ties to Revelation, balancing brevity with meaningful explanation. Let me know if you need further details or a different approach!
